        <h3>CHARITY</h3>
    <p>Charity is one of the most noble tasks that a man can do in his life. Gajjala Yoganand firmly believes that the true meaning of life is to celebrate joy of giving. He is realizing this dream by engaging in acts of charity.
    </p>

    <p>
    He loves his fellow-beings and likes to help them in distress.He is very sensitive to the feelings of others.The sight of pain or misery troubles him and he tries his level best to alleviate that misery.He is deeply moved  at the sight of beggars, or victims of natural calamities such as floods,earthquakes and recently Covid-19 Crisis.
    </p>

    <p>
    The gap between the rich and the poor is widening.While on one hand, we have the billionaire businessmen, sport stars and movie stars.While on the other hand we have millions of diseased and starving men,women and children dying for that one morsel of grain that would keep them alive.
    </p>
        
    <p>
    If all the rich people and even people who are reasonably well-off contribute something in terms of money,food,clothes or even empathy, then the world would definitely be better off.
    But this does not necessarily mean that one has to be a billionaire to show charity.Even simple actions like feeding a poor man for a day, or teaching a poor kid are acts of charity. Every person can do his own bit , and it would make some difference to another person's life. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
     So, as a common man and peoples' man Gajjala Yoganand has conceptualized GYFoundation as an attempt to do something for the society.
